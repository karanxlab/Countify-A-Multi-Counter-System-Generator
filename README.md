# Countify : A Multi-Counter System Generator
Sequential counter design is traditionally a manual, time-intensive process involving state table construction, flip-flop excitation derivation, Boolean minimization, and HDL coding, making it highly prone to human error and inefficiency. To address these limitations, this project proposes a Counter Design Automation Tool that automates the complete sequential counter design workflow from high-level state specifications.

The proposed system takes a user-defined state sequence and flip-flop type (D, T, JK, SR) as inputs and algorithmically derives present-state/next-state relationships, minimized excitation equations, and finite state machine (FSM) representations. Using symbolic Boolean computation (SymPy) and logic synthesis algorithms, the tool generates optimized logic expressions, which are further translated into gate-level visualizations and synthesizable Verilog code with automated testbenches. An AST-based parsing approach is employed to convert Boolean expressions into hardware-realistic logic diagrams.

The automation framework significantly reduces design time while improving accuracy, reproducibility, and design clarity. By bridging the gap between theoretical sequential logic design and practical hardware implementation, the tool supports digital design education, FPGA prototyping, embedded systems development, and early-stage VLSI workflows. This work demonstrates how algorithm-driven automation can enhance productivity and reliability in sequential circuit design.
